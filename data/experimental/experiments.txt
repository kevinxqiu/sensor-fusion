1- 4 IR sensors are being used.
	- 2 short range sensor
	- 1 medium range sensor
	- 1 long range sensor

2- Distances between the aluminum sheet and each sensor in the setup:
	- short range sensor -> 6 cm (both are north in images)
	- medium range sensor -> 12 cm (north east in images)
	- long range sensor -> 22 cm (south east in images)

3- Thermocouple sensor positions
	- A0 -> north west (col 1 in data)
	- A1 -> south west (col 2 in data)
	- A2 -> center (col 3 in data)
	- A3 -> north east (col 4 in data)
	- A4 -> south east (col 5 in data)

2- The position of the block is captured captured at
	- North east (image attached)
	- North west (image attached)
	- South east (image attached)
	- South west (image attached)
	- center (image attached)
	- south (image attached)
