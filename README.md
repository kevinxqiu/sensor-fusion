# Complete Sensor Fusion System

A heat source is localized using different sensors carried out in simulation and experimentation.

## Goals
* Implement all levels of a complete sensor fusion system
* Use different sensor types to fuse data to localize a heat source
* Use effective decision making techniques to corretly identify the location of a heat source
